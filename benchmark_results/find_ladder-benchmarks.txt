# This find_ladder implementation only used priority sorting


# Observation: William L. Webber was a Michigan politician. Michigan is a state in the USA. 12 Downing Street is a building in London, England. 
#              The algorithm needs to find a connection from an American person to a British building and the result can be seen below.
#              For a while, it was very focused on different things related to Michigan like elections and politicians. 
#              Then it went onto a more general path to the United States, then to some musicians. 
#              Suddenly it decided to check out a plane crash which seemed unrelated at first but, it got to BBC (the British Broadcasting Corporation)! 
#              Turns out that this station had covered the accident in the past. From now on it went relatively smooth and it reached the destination.
